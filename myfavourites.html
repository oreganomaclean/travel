	  <h2>Interlaken</h2>
	  <!-- adding in a second hyperlink for a hostel I recommend to anyone -->
	  <p3>Switzerland was one of the most beautiful countries on my travels. The mountains, the
	  fresh air and the people made the place so invtiting and enjoyable. Definitely will have to go back! 
		  This picture was taken in Interlaken. If you are interested in staying in a hostel, I would definitely stay at
